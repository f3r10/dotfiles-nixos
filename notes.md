* Flakes
`nixos-rebuild build --flake .#` will generate the flake.block and a result folder from which it is possible to apply the configuration with `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#`

[x] alacritty
[x] fish
[ ] xmonad scripts
[x] tmux
  [ ] styles
[x] clipboard for tmux and neovim
[x] migrate from enpass to pass and dmenu
  At the end because I also needed to mange my password from my mobile I decided
  to choose keepassxs as my default password manager. It does not have a nice
  integration like pass but I can create a scratchpad in my xmonad
  configuration.
